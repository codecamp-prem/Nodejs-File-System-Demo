The fs module
All you need to work with the filesystem is inside the fs module that is part of the core library
that came with Node.js.
The fs module is a sort of wrapper around the standard POSIX functions and exposes a lot of
methods to access and work with the filesystem. Most of them are in two flavors: the default
async version and the sync version. Even if the async version is preferable, sometimes the sync
version is useful for some tasks that don't need extreme performance.
